This repository provides the scripts and data for SHAPE-based arterial pressure reconstruction, supporting a manuscript to be submitted for publication.

This study aims to verify the technical feasibility of ECG-gated Subharmonic-Aided Arterial Pressure Estimation.

In this study, GEHC Logiq E20 was used to perform subharmonic-aided pressure estimation on AO artery of three rabbits. Since the maximum frame rate of subharmonic imaging is no greater than 17 FRS, it is impossible to obtain the arterial pressure estimation on these rabbit who have the heart beat rate more than 100 beats per second. By using ECG gating technique and long time acquisiton of subharmonic amplitude signals, we could synchonize the subharmonic amplitude signals within a normalized beat cycle, thus reconstruct the arterial pressure waveform with proper filtering.

The provided codes and data provides an easy access of the scripts for data analysis and plotting.
